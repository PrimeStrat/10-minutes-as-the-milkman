# 10 Minutes as the Milkman - Demo Build

This is my first attempt at learning game development through the creation of an indie game via Godot.

# How to run the game?

1. Download Godot: https://godotengine.org/download/windows/
2. Download the Git repository
3. Import the project into Godot
4. Run the project

# What's in the game currently?

- A playable character
- One enemy that chases the player
- The ability to fire projectiles

# Future Plans

- There are currently no plans to continue this project, rather, this project is likely to be turned into a Godot template for other developments. You can read more in my paper here: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Lb87vdjyEbR5PRNLnwpTBg7XEgzbNqmiupRyDbZ313k/edit?usp=sharing
- You MUST go to the same school as my to access the doc.
